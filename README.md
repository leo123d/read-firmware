Read Pico is an ESP32-S3 development board in the Read series with a 4.7" monochrome e-paper panel,
made by Shenzhen MindReset Technology Co., Ltd. This repository trims the
[factory demo firmware](https://github.com/MindReset/read_pico_firmware) down to a
**reading-only** build.

It boots straight into the shelf. The menu has five entries: Books / Transfer / Font /
Storage / Settings. The demo and diagnostic pages used to check the hardware piece by
piece (overview, refresh bench, reading demo, touch, accelerometer, power and battery,
PMU protocol, power key, sleep, TF card and buzzer, expander) are removed from the
source. The device self-test leaves the menu and opens only from the boot power-cut
resume or a long press on the About heading in Settings.

Board support, PMU protocol host and chip drivers remain independent, reusable
components. Browser flashing over WebSerial lives in [webflash/](webflash/); you can
also build from source as below.

Agent-facing layout, `app_desc_t` contract, glossary and comment style are in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Build & Flash

Requires ESP-IDF v6.1. `components/read_pico/read_pico_flash_hpm.c` depends on
`esp_flash_chips/spi_flash_override.h`, which is available only in v6.

```sh
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem* flash monitor
```

The 120 MHz flash / PSRAM timing in `sdkconfig.defaults` depends on the flash part
installed on the board. CI uses `sdkconfig.ci` with default timing only to check
compilation; see [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml).

If the device is not recognized after waking from sleep during development or
flashing:

1. Try a USB Type-A data cable.
2. Put the device to sleep and wake it again.
3. Reboot the board and retry.

The panel VCOM is calibrated at the factory and stored in the PMU. The firmware
reads it once at boot to configure the driver; it is neither stored locally nor
user-editable.

## Pages

The function menu lists pages in the order defined in
[main/app/app_registry.c](main/app/app_registry.c).

| Page | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Books | UTF-8 / GBK TXT and EPUB from TF or internal storage, chapters, font size and per-book progress; swipe to turn, hold text for TOC and hold a shelf row for details, progress reset or confirmed deletion; filter storage sources, sort by name or recent reading, and search by pinyin, initials or English; single-book actions use a popup, while management supports batch selection, progress reset/deletion and rescan; experimental shake-to-turn defaults off. EPUB navigation supports NCX and nav documents. **Boot page.** |
| Transfer | Device hotspot or existing WiFi, with browser TXT/EPUB upload and complete TTF font uploads to TF; TF card preferred, internal storage limited to 1 MB per file. Scan the hotspot QR to join, or select a 2.4 GHz network and enter its password on the touchscreen. Web provisioning remains available. The browser lists and searches books in the current upload destination, confirms replacement or deletion, and supports upload cancellation and retry. Saved WiFi can be forgotten on the device. Leaving the page stops networking. |
| Font | Pick the built-in font or a card TTF with a tap, see a live type preview, and switch weight (light / regular / bold); the font and weight are remembered |
| Storage | TF card capacity and mount status, remount, and format (two confirmations, erases the card). The self-rescue entry after a card loss |
| Settings | Reading prefs (default size 36–72, shake turn), sleep and wake (light / deep / off, pickup wake) and About (battery and charging, build UTC time, free storage). Hold the About heading to open the device self-test |

The device self-test and factory VCOM setup stay out of the menu: the self-test opens only
from the boot power-cut resume or a long press on the About heading in Settings; when VCOM is
unset the boot gates into the setup page.

In Books, KEY1 / KEY2 / KEY3 select previous page / toolbar / next page. The toolbar includes full refresh. Hold KEY2 for 500 ms to open the menu. Other pages retain KEY2 full GC16 refresh and KEY3 menu. Menu rows select on release; slide away to cancel.

To add a page, create a file in `main/apps/`, implement the `app_desc_t`
callbacks you need and add it to the menu table in `main/app/app_registry.c`.
The main loop stays untouched.

## Transfer and limitations

AP and existing WiFi modes provide a QR code for the upload page. AP can switch between joining WiFi and opening the page. The device labels its build timestamp as UTC.

The transfer server runs only on its page and stops on exit. It uses local-network HTTP without separate login or TLS; peers on that network can manage books in the active upload storage, so use a trusted network. Saved WiFi credentials reside in device NVS and are not returned by public endpoints or logs. NVS/flash encryption is not enabled, so this does not provide physical-access protection.

Stopping transfer returns to the entry page or menu position. When a mounted TF card becomes unavailable, affected reading/transfer stops and fonts fall back; explicitly remount from the TF page after reinserting it. Removing a card during writes can damage the filesystem. EPUB opens text with image placeholders. Tap a placeholder to load that local JPEG/PNG in a separate, proportionally scaled preview; tap the preview, the return button, or any of the three keys to return to the same text position without repagination. Chapter opening, page turns and prepainting do not decode images. ZIP entries, manifest items and spine chapters are each limited to 32768; OPF/navigation metadata is limited to 4 MiB uncompressed and chapter/image reads to 2 MiB. The ZIP central directory has an 8 MiB limit; title storage has a 1 MiB budget, with numbered fallback titles beyond it. Entries above 4 MiB are rejected even when unused. These are independent memory/resource limits, so chapter count alone does not guarantee acceptance; ZIP64 and books over 32768 entries or chapters are unsupported. Externally replaced files or another card with the same path and file size may still match old reading progress. Pending retries after failed saves are not guaranteed to survive power loss.

Entering Books offers to resume the previous book; staying on the shelf does not open it (KEY1 cancels, KEY3 resumes). The reader parses metadata and the current chapter, then paginates the first two pages or through the saved position. Remaining pagination advances two pages at a time; other chapters load on demand. The page total shows “…” while incomplete; entering the previous chapter at its last page still requires paginating that chapter. Width measurement uses resident font tables without rasterizing a whole chapter. Opening and chapter loading retain waiting hints and visible failure reasons (memory, limits, unsupported format or invalid file).

Swipe page turns commit on release at 64 pixels (previously 120); movement beyond the 24-pixel tap tolerance but below the swipe threshold cancels, and an image-placeholder swipe turns the page without loading the image.

Illustration limits: baseline JPEG favors decode-time scaling with at most 2x enlargement to the display size, up to 16M source pixels and 8192 per side; PNG and progressive JPEG allow up to 1M source pixels and a 4 MiB decoder heap. Output fits 648x1000 grayscale pixels; transparent PNG uses a white background. Only the most recently viewed image in the current chapter is cached; closing a preview and reopening that same image reuses it. Missing, corrupt, oversized or unsupported images show an explanation on request and leave text readable. Repeated references to the same normalized EPUB resource path show “重复图片” and the earliest numbered section among chapters visited during this book opening (EPUB section order includes covers and front matter, so it can differ from printed chapter numbers). Opening image blocks immediately followed by a heading, and recognized references to those same resources, use a separate “标题图” label without the first-location line; other illustrations keep the visited-origin hint. This is not a scan of unread chapters or a claim about the first occurrence in the whole book; the history resets when the book closes. Identical content under different resource paths is not matched. JPEG/PNG references inside SVG wrappers work; pure SVG vectors, CSS backgrounds and remote images do not. See [decoder sources and licenses](main/book/vendor/README.md).

The built-in font covers the UI text only. For external Chinese books, place a complete Chinese TTF in `fonts/` or `assets/fonts/` on the TF card and select it on the Fonts page. The default path is `fonts/ChillDuanSansVF.ttf`; for missing characters, check that the file exists and the selected font covers them. A complete font and its copyright notices are provided in the [TF deployment package](sdcard/README.md). The webpage also accepts fonts into `/sdcard/fonts`: up to 32 MiB per TTF with TrueType outlines, excluding OTF/CFF, TTC and WOFF. Capacity is checked first, replacements require confirmation, and interrupted or invalid uploads retain the old file. Stop transfer, then select the font on the device. Transfer temporarily uses the built-in font to avoid replacing an open font; the saved selection is retained.
